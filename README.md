# CSS Background Image Application Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to CSS background images. The issue is that the background image is not being applied correctly in some browsers. The problem occurs due to the interaction between the `background-size` property and the dimensions of the image.  The `bug.css` file contains the buggy CSS. The solution is provided in `bugSolution.css`.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in a browser.
2. Observe the behavior of the div element with a background image.

## Solution

The solution is detailed in `bugSolution.css`.  It addresses the incompatibility by explicitly setting the `background-size` to ensure proper rendering across different browsers and image dimensions.
